# AI ChatBot

## Overview

Welcome to the AI ChatBot folder of the Codeucate project! This folder contains the code for the AI trainer, which is designed to answer students' questions and provide assistance in their learning journey using the Gemini AI - API by Google.

## Installation

To set up and run the AI ChatBot locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies for the project.
2. **Add API Key**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Gemini API key as follows:

   ```
   API_KEY="Paste API Key here"
   ```

   Replace `"Paste API Key here"` with your actual Gemini API key obtained from Google.
3. **Start the ChatBot**: After adding the API key, you can start the AI ChatBot by running the appropriate command (e.g., `node server.js`). This will launch the ChatBot locally(usually at PORT:3000) and make it accessible for interaction.
4. **Search on Browser**: Search for `localhost:3000`, in the browser to access the chatbot trainer.

## Usage

Once the AI ChatBot is up and running, users can interact with it by sending queries and receiving responses. The ChatBot utilizes the Gemini AI - API to understand and respond to a wide range of questions related to education.
